In this project, the time-frequency analysis and HOG feature extraction are placed in the folder named Image Transform, you can see the file named Method, which is 4 kinds of time-frequency analysis (CWT, STFT, MSST and FSST2) and HOG feature extraction code. I also put the data enhancement code in a folder called tool.
Second, the deep learning related code was placed in a folder called CNN, and the folder named model was the code for the five deep learning networks I called (Resnet, Efficientnet, Vgg, Mobilenet, and Desenet). Since the number of channels used in the image is 3 and the hog feature value is 1, pay attention to distinguish the suffix that has been marked out in my code name. At the same time, you can train these 5 networks in the folder named train, and finally draw the ROC curve in the folder of AUC.
